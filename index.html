            <p>
              JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[6] often abbreviated as JS, is a
              programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript
              specification.[7] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time
              compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic
              typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class
              functions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies
              of the World Wide Web.[8] JavaScript enables interactive web pages
              and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of
              websites use it for client-side page behavior,[9] and all major
              web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven,
              functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application
              programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates,
              regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document
              Object Model (DOM). However, the language itself does not include
              any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics
              facilities, as the host environment (usually a web browser)
              provides those APIs.
            </p>
            <p>
              JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but
              they are now embedded in some servers, usually via Node.js. They
              are also embedded in a variety of applications created with
              frameworks such as Electron and Cordova. Although there are
              similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name,
              syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are
              distinct and differ greatly in design.

              Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming
              language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991,
              Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its
              notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and
              object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear,
              logical code for small and large-scale projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports
              multiple programming paradigms, including structured
              (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and functional
              programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included"
              language due to its comprehensive standard library.[29] Python was
              conceived in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC language.
              Python 2.0, released in 2000, introduced features like list
              comprehensions and a garbage collection system capable of
              collecting reference cycles. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a
              major revision of the language that is not completely
              backward-compatible, and much Python 2 code does not run
              unmodified on Python 3.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Python 2 language was officially discontinued in 2020 (first
              planned for 2015), and "Python 2.7.18 is the last Python 2.7
              release and therefore the last Python 2 release."[30] No more
              security patches or other improvements will be released for
              it.[31][32] With Python 2's end-of-life, only Python 3.5.x[33] and
              later are supported.

              Python interpreters are available for many operating systems. A
              global community of programmers develops and maintains CPython, an
              open source[34] reference implementation. A non-profit
              organization, the Python Software Foundation, manages and directs
              resources for Python and CPython development.

              Java is a general-purpose programming language that is
              class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few
              implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let
              application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17]
              meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that
              support Java without the need for recompilation.[18] Java
              applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on
              any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying
              computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++,
              but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. As of
              2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in
              use according to GitHub,[19][20] particularly for client-server
              web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[21] Java
              was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems
              (which has since been acquired by Oracle) and released in 1995 as
              a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original
              and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and
              class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary
              licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of
              the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java
              technologies under the GNU General Public License. Meanwhile,
              others have developed alternative implementations of these Sun
              technologies, such as the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode
              compiler), GNU Classpath (standard libraries), and IcedTea-Web
              (browser plugin for applets).
            </p>
            <p>
              The latest versions are Java 14, released in March 2020, and Java
              11, a currently supported long-term support (LTS) version,
              released on September 25, 2018; Oracle released for the legacy
              Java 8 LTS the last free public update in January 2019 for
              commercial use, while it will otherwise still support Java 8 with
              public updates for personal use up to at least December 2020.
              Oracle (and others) highly recommend uninstalling older versions
              of Java because of serious risks due to unresolved security
              issues.[22] Since Java 9, 10, 12 and 13 are no longer supported,
              Oracle advises its users to immediately transition to the latest
              version (currently Java 14) or an LTS release.

              React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is an open-source
              JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained
              by Facebook and a community of individual developers and
              companies. React can be used as a base in the development of
              single-page or mobile applications. However, React is only
              concerned with rendering data to the DOM, and so creating React
              applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for
              state management and routing. Redux and React Router are
              respective examples of such libraries.
            </p>
            <strong>Components</strong>
            <p>
              React code is made of entities called components. Components can
              be rendered to a particular element in the DOM using the React DOM
              library. When rendering a component, one can pass in values that
              are known as "props": The two primary ways of declaring components
              in React is via functional components and class-based components.
              Functional components are declared with a function that then
              returns some JSX. Class-based components are declared using ES6
              classes. They are also known as "stateful" components, because
              their state can hold values throughout the component and can be
              passed to child components through props:
